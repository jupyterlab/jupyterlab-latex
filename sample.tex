We can write equations:
\begin{equation}
    \rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} \right) =
    -\nabla P + \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} + \rho \mathbf{g}.
\label{eq:Navier–Stokes}
\end{equation}
\\
And we can write tables:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | l | c | r| }
    \hline
    1 & 2 & 3 \\ 
    4 & 5 & 6 \\ 
    7 & 8 & 9 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

We can reference equations by their numbers, i.e. Equation (\ref{eq:Navier–Stokes}).

Hello
We can reference equations by their numbers, i.e. Equation (\ref{eq:Navier–Stokes}).


\subsection{We can add new subsections}
And we can include images, such as the Jupyter logo:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{images/jupyter_logo.png}
\end{center}
